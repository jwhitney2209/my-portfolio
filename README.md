# My Portfolio Challenge

In this challenge I had to develop a portfolio website for myself with no starter code. The website structure was built with HTML and styled with CSS. 

## Website Features
Features of the website include:
- My Biography:  a short bio of who I am! 
- My Works: images and links to projects I've worked on, starting with the most recent
- Contact Information
